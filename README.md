**TODO:**

- [X] User can set own homepage
- [X] Error Page now shows a different page depending on the Error instead of just saying "an error occoured"
- [X] User is able to see the current URL for the page they are on
- [X] (sort of) Browser does not require "https://" or "http://" in the url for it to load as a url
- [X] Permanent Settings
